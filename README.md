# FARMINGTON-WEB-APP

FARMINGTON is a web application built using various machine learning algorithms, image recognition and API integration. 
Our major goal is to connect the farmers to the digital world:)

Our app also has 3 main functionalities:

FEATURES:

•	In the crop recommendation application, the user can provide the soil data from their side and the application will predict which crop should the user grow.
•	For the fertilizer recommendation application, the user can input the soil data and the type of crop they are growing, and the application will predict what the soil lacks or has excess of and will recommend improvements.
•	For the last application, that is the plant disease prediction application, the user can input an image of a diseased plant leaf, and the application will predict what disease it is and will also give a little  background about the disease and suggestions to cure it.
