# FARMINGTON-WEB-APP

FARMINGTON is a web application built using various machine learning algorithms, image recognition and API integration. 
Our major goal is to connect the farmers to the digital world:)

Our app also has 3 main functionalities:

- A CROP RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
- A FERTILIZER SUGGESTION SYSTEM
- A DISEASE DETECTION SYSTEM



FEATURES:

•	In the crop recommendation application, the user can provide the soil data from their side and the application will predict which crop should the user grow.
•	For the fertilizer recommendation application, the user can input the soil data and the type of crop they are growing, and the application will predict what the soil lacks or has excess of and will recommend improvements.
•	For the last application, that is the plant disease prediction application, the user can input an image of a diseased plant leaf, and the application will predict what disease it is and will also give a little  background about the disease and suggestions to cure it.



OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT:

•	To facilitate transformation of traditional farming system into a commercial and technology based sustainable enterprise to maximize farmer's farm income.
•	To facilitate the promotion, consolidation and sustainability of farming business by facilitating quality services viz. knowledge technology, credit, inputs, marketing and value addition under business partnership model.
•	Farming is one of the major sectors that influences a country’s economic growth. In country like India, majority of the population is dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. 
•	Many new technologies, such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning, are being implemented into agriculture so that it is easier for farmers to grow and maximize their yield.
